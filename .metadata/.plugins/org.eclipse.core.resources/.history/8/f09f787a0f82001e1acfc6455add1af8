/*Final keyword
-> final is a keyword or modifier which can be used at variables, methods & classes.
-> If we declare a variable as final then we can’t modify value of the variable. The variable acts like a constant. Final field must be initialized when it is declared.
-> If we declare a method as final then we can't override that method
-> If we declare a class as final then we can't extend from that class. We cannot inherit final class in Java.
